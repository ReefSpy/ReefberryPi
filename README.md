# Reefberry Pi

![dashboard](./docs/assets/Dashboard-1.png)

Reefberry Pi is an aquarium controller built with a Raspberry Pi 
single board computer.  I started this project to learn new skills and see what I could accomplish with this device and off the shelf components.  It is a work in progress and I have lots of ideas for things I'd like to implement.  Feel free to follow along on this journey!
